# 112-Term-project
THE PROJECT

What this program does is take in a monophonic piano input with notes in the range A2-G5#, and does several layers of signal processing and sound analysis to output the sheet music for the audio

When run, user is prompted to select a wav file to analyze, which the program will take time processing and eventually tkinter will draw the sheet music output

This project makes use of tkinter and numPy


Breakdown of all files:

main file is where the program is run

fourierAnalysis file contains the super math heavy algorithmically complex stuff, where all of the notes are manipulated

keys file contains two dictionaries that map frequencies to notes and notes to the staff lines they go on

drawMusic file draws sheet music

staff and note are classes that are used mostly for draw methods but some other properties too

tpTestCases are test functions for various assertion-testable things written (doesn't include graphic testing)
